  <div class="content">
    <p>The vertical slice for our game <span class="specialText">Project Juggler</span> is comprised of a complete level with an introductory tutorial where the player entirely controls a mech that can move, look around, and shoot within a three-dimensional environment, controlling similarly to a first-person shooter.</p>
    <p>As an additional challenge, however, the player must also maintain their own physical and mental wellbeing; this is done by navigating within the mech to complete tasks such as drinking tea or doing homework.</p>
    <p>Players must defend the city's residents from invading robots while keeping themselves in peak condition.</p>

    <p><center><u><b>LoFi Core Gameplay</b></u><br><br>
      <i>Creating a Wave-Based Enemy Spawn System with Objectives</i><br><br>
      <img src="assets/proto1.png" alt="LoFi Core Gameplay 1"><br><br><br>
      Design Questions Asked:
      <li>How can we incentivize players to defend the objective from the enemies?</li>
      <li>How can we create a balanced difficulty with downtime between enemy waves?</li><br>
      Knowledge Gained:
      <li>We learned how to prototype games in Baba is You.</li>
      <li>We learned how to create a balance through “downtime” between waves of enemies.</li>
      <li>We learned about what the limits are for spawning waves of enemies such as how
        frequently the next wave occurs, how many enemies are spawned in each wave, and
        how deadly each enemy should be.</li><br><br>
      <i>Handling Multiple Tasks in a Stress-Inducing Circumstance</i><br><br>
      <img src="assets/proto2.png" alt="LoFi Core Gameplay 2"><br><br>
      Design Questions Asked:
      <li>How can we induce stress and anxiety through the requirement of multi-tasking?</li>
      <li>How do players manage handling multiple responsibilities at once?</li><br>
      Knowledge Gained:
      <li>We learned that multi-tasking, while very difficult, is possible given the right
        circumstances (Need breathing room from attacks, using the opposition to your
        advantage to allow for breathing room, perhaps other controllable ways for the player to
        find a moment to relax)</li>
      <li>We learned about a potential way to implement a unique form of multi-tasking
        (handling two different control schemes at once to perform different or similar tasks)</li>
      <li>Stress and anxiety can be good motivators/challenges for the player provided that they
        have the tools and means to manage them (refer back to “breathing room” and
        “breaks”)</li><br><br>
      -----------------------------------------------------<br>
      <u><b>HiFi Scene Flow</b></u><br><br>
      <i>Automatically Swapping Between Game Modes</i><br>
      <img src="assets/proto3.png" alt="HiFi Scene Flow 1"><br><br><br>
      Design Questions Asked:
      <li>How can we make the transition between fighting and completing events feel seamless?</li>
      <li>How can we balance the information between both states of play (combat and event
        completion), so, while the player is one, they can still keep track of the other?</li><br>
      Knowledge Gained:
      <li>People liked the smooth movement transitions, but felt it was too smooth or robotic</li>
      <li>We also learned that even when you flash a warning in front of people's face, they tend
        to ignore it.</li>
      <li>Forcibly changing the player's controls can be jarring, unless it is expected. And, given a
        clear transition, the player can learn to expect such transitions.</li><br><br>
      <i>Navigation Between Activities Within Mech is Clear</i><br><br>
      <img src="assets/proto4.png" alt="LoFi Scene Flow 2"><br><br>
      Design Questions Asked:
      <li>How can moving through the mech's panels be understandable?</li>
      <li>Does the flow between panels ever get tedious or boring?</li>
      <li>How easy is it to get "lost" inside the mech?</li><br>
      Knowledge Gained:
      <li>The interior of the mech is not confusing at all. The wheel helps, but mostly with event
        navigation.</li>
      <li>The movement is fast and smooth enough that it does not feel tedious.</li>
      <li>If anything, the most boring part of transitioning between panels is the fact that there is
        not much inside the mech.</li><br><br></center>
